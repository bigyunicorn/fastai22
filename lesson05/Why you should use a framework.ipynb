    "# A few key points from the lesson 05\n",
    "* I created a deep learning neural network from the scratch using python and pytorch in [my another notebook](https://github.com/bigyunicorn/fastai22/blob/main/lesson05/Linear_model_and_neural_net_from_scratch.ipynb) by following Jeremy's notebook, [Linear model and neural net from scratch](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/linear-model-and-neural-net-from-scratch). \n",
    "* In this notebook, I am going to create a deep learning neural network by using the fastai library and other libraries. \n",
    "* The benefits of using the libraries are (coming from Jeremy's notebook):\n",
    "  - Best practices are handled for you automatically -- fast.ai has done thousands of hours of experiments to figure out what the best settings are for you.\n",
    "  - Less time getting set up, which means more time to try out your new ideas.\n",
    "  - Each idea you try will be less work, because fastai and PyTorch will do the many of the menial bits for you.\n",
    "  - You can still do customization:\n",
    "    - You can always drop down from fastai to PyTorch if you need to customise any part (or drop down from the fastai Application API to the fastai mid or low tier APIs), or even drop down from PyTorch to plain python for deep customisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Important Context\n",
    "* The given problem we are going to use:\n",
    "  - We are tasked to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n",
    "  - This is a very beginner frinedly kaggle competition. [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/evaluation).\n",
    "  - You can find the data here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data\n",
    "  - The metric(evaluation) we are going to use is accuracy. You can find the information in the [evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/evaluation) tab.\n",
    "* This is the same data we used for the [Lesson 03](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson3.html) where we created a neural net from the scratch in the excel.\n",
